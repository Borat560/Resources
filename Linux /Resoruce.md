# Distro 

Start using one of these Linux Distributions and not windows for any development or learning 

- Linux Mint- [link](https://linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=305)

  Very familiar looking when compared to windows.
  Watch any youtube video at the top of the search result and follow the steps carefully . If anythung dosent work open an issue on this repo , we will check it if possible.
  Any tutuorial to setup any software installtion that works with ubuntu or debian should work with linux mint also

- Ubuntu- [Link](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)

  Linux mint is based on ubuntu but is without snap packages so prefer linux mint over ubuntu.
  Begginer freindly distribution .
  Download only the Long term support or LTS version of ubuntu do not use anything else because other releases are phased out after roughly 6 months or so.

- Fedora- [Link](https://fedoraproject.org/)
  
  
  Good distro rolling release distro, not recommened for beggningers because most of the tutorials on youtube are not made for fedora but instead for ubuntu. Use the workstation or edition only for your laptop or PC *NOT* the server, IOT , cloud or core os edition. Stable distro but DO not install it if you dont know what a BIOS update is.

  In fedora if you update the system from the Gnome-software-center sometimes you may recive a BIOS update which you may unknowingly download but when you restart ,it start the update at CPU fans running at full speed and if you dont have enough charge on your laptop or electricty supply is cut you made render you *PC UNUSABLE* unless you get it fixed from a authorized service center of the laptop or motherboard.
  check the firmware updater package fwup or cehck the list of companies which use Insyde software soultions to send BIOS update and if your PC brand is mentioned do not use this ditro.  

# Flashing the distro 

- Use a usb drive 8gb or more for all the distros mentioned above.
  Download and install [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) 
  open rufus , the default setting should be fine and it should pick your usb drive immediately and click run . It will delete all your data on the usb drive  and then make the usb drive a bootbale device 

- [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/download.html) 
  
  If you start distro hopping this tool might save you a lot of time and effort.
  Once you install it to your usb drive you just need to copy paste any iso into the usb drive and next time u boot from the drive u can directly boot from the iso you pasted and install the distro.
